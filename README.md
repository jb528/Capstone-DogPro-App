DogPro App

Short Project Description 
DogPro is a comprehensive web application designed to simplify and manage all aspects of dog care. 
It provides a user-friendly interface where dog owners can create, update, and manage pet profiles.

Overview 
The DogPro web application provides a back-end service layer for our Dog Profile Management system. 
It handles the communication with the database, takes care of data storage and retrieval, 
and provides data to the front-end User Interface (UI) as needed.

How It Works 
The service layer of DogPro accepts requests from the UI, processes these requests, communicates 
with the database, and returns the appropriate responses to the UI. This allows the application to 
manage various dog profiles and track schedules and training plans efficiently.
